# Showerloop (modification)

This prototype can be useful in conditions with lack of access to centralized water supply, as well as used in projects whose task is to minimize the useage of natural resources. It is designed for places where there is a shortage of water or difficulties with the disposal of gray water. It is suitable for autonomous houses in which it is impossible to connect to communications.

Prototype based on existing open-source project [**Showerloop**](https://www.instructables.com/Showerloop), modified and adopted to the Ukrainian context

The ShowerLoop implementation has the following features:
  - fully automatic modes: Loop and cleaning, activated according to the operating time of the main pump. If desired, you can turn on the manual cleaning mode
  - a multi-stage septic tank, as the first element of cleaning, allows you to significantly extend the life of the main carbon filters
  - simplifying and reducing the cost of construction. We have only 1 electro-mechanical valve. In the original solution - 5. The main carbon filters are significantly smaller, cheaper and simpler than in the original. There is an idea how to simplify them (and all pipes) in the next version.

Management is maximally simplified and designed even for children. The boiler should be turned on a little in advance. The user then opens the faucet and adjusts the temperature, as in a regular shower. During the hour of operation of the pump, the cleaning system turns on automatically, but not before the user closes the faucet. At this moment, almost all the water from the first septic tank is drained. In the next session of the system, water is supplied from the outside until the tank from which it drained is full. Manual "bypass" mode is needed if you need to wash something dirty. Then the water is supplied from the outside, does not go through the filters and is immediately pumped out when it enters the tank.
